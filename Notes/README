Note, a basic full random partition generator
=============================================
This is a very symple project developped to help someone on a forum.

those person needs some help to get randomly generated sequences of 
(musical) notes according to some rules.

Developing this project, my aims was to give him a POC for a simple 
class which provid correct services and a (really simple) application
as example.

I'm not sure that this project may be usable for anyone else the person on
the forum, but, here is it.
